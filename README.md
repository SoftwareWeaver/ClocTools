# cloctools
A python script which uses the tool "cloc" to count the lines, comments and blanks of different programming languages for each commit in a git repository. The purpose of this script is to measure my progress in learning the Swift Programming Language. My goal is, to add more than 100 lines of swift code to a code base every day. Overall i want to write more than 15.000 lines of swift code in 12 weeks.
